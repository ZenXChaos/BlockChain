# PHP-Blockchain

Original Concept: https://github.com/rhondle/BlockChain
A very simple BlockChain implementation intended to illustrate the concept.

Project intentions:
This project is geared toward PHP developers who want to take advantage of Blockchain technology while still maintaining complete control over the data.

At the moment, this project is under construction. Updates coming soon! :)
